My name is Savan Visalpara and I am a Master's student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am interested in applied deep learning and adversarial machine learning. In the past, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for one year. In this role, I trained and deployed various kinds of Deep Learning models for different Computer Vision problems. Some of the projects I have worked on include Object Detection and Segmentation, Image-based Relocalization, and Computer Vision-based Exercise Classification and Counting.
