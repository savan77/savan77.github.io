      " \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \n",
      "the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \n",
      "then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . \n",
      "dah-dum . \n",
      "from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \n",
      "right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \n",
      "perhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \n",
      "he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \n",
      "unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \n",
      "until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . \n",
      "he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . \n",
      "he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . \n",
      "the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \n",
      "the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \n",
      "brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \n",
      "hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \n",
      "when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \n",
      "the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n",
      " \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \n",
      "it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \n",
      "even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \n",
      "although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \n",
      "the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \n",
      "scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \n",
      "nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \n",
      "scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . \n",
      " \" it's your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \n",
      "dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \n",
      "however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \n",
      "bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \n",
      "he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . \n",
      "however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \n",
      "quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \n",
      "indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \n",
      "his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \n",
      "shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \n",
      "of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \n",
      "a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \n",
      "every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \n",
      "the shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \n",
      "many have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \n",
      "but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n",
